# Squid60_Plate_Files

Files for the Squid60 keyboard designed by me as a commission for Chewwy. Includes alps plates for those that want to get those made.



IMPORTANT: For the alps plates with alps stabs it might be best to remove the non-flipped stab hole cutouts (the lower two rectangles that are close to the mounting tabs) if you don't plan on using a non-flipped spacebar. I left it there for the option of the end user, but would highly recommend removing them as it does remove material very close to the mounting tabs.

WARNING: If you plan on using alps switches please note you either have to order a 1.5mm plate or a 1.2mm plate and use a gasket on the top of the plate tabs in order to fill the gap between it and the case or the plate will rattle around a lot. Being sandwich mount the plate thickness is important.
